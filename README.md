# Updates  
**January 10, 2021**  
Added new *House Party* Stickers  
Added new *Mallow The Rascal* Stickers & Lotties  

**Coming Soon**  
Hello Wumpus  
Wumpus Nitro Elite  

*Converting these to GIFs take a while...*  
If you want to convert them yourself, download the Lotties and convert them here: https://lottiefiles.com/lottie-to-gif  
I used **#ffffff00** and **200x200** Resolution.  

# Where are the others?
I could not download the other sticker packs due to them being Lottie JSONs instead of APNGs.  
They are higher quality so Discord uses Lottie JSONs to reduce on file size.  
The plugin I use to download these cannot convert these to Gifs. (unfortunately)  
They are free for users with Nitro anyways. (except for Clyde Winter)  

I'll try to convert them all later.
