Wumpus & Co: Winter Fun  
Clyde Winter (BUGGY)  
House Party  
Mallow The Rascal  

**Update**  
Converted all the Clyde Winter stickers. The face is transparent for some reason but that's how it converted so whatever.  
If you want to convert them yourself, download **Clyde Winter Lottie.zip** and convert them here: https://lottiefiles.com/lottie-to-gif  
I used **#ffffff00** and **200x200** Resolution.

**Coming Soon**  
Hello Wumpus  
Wumpus Nitro Elite  
*Converting these to GIFs take a while...*  

# Where are the others?
I could not download the other sticker packs due to them being Lottie JSONs instead of APNGs.  
They are higher quality so Discord uses Lottie JSONs to reduce on file size.  
The plugin I use to download these cannot convert these to Gifs. (unfortunately)  
They are free for users with Nitro anyways. (except for Clyde Winter)  

I'll try to convert them all later.
